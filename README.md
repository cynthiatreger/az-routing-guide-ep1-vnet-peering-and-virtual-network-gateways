## 1.1. Discovery/Reminder of Azure VNET connectivity principles

### 1.1.1.	VNET peering & Effective routes

To start, we will consider 2 peered VNETs and a VM in Spoke1 VNET. A single IP range* is allocated to each VNET. In the example below, each IP range is broken into 2 subnets.

(* an Azure Virtual Network (VNET) is made of one or multiple IP ranges and each range is split into subnets)
